## History... and future

Data admin was developed by the https://frepple.com as a component in
a demand forecasting, inventory planning and prodution planning
application. This application has been in production use for many years
at many customers now. 

We strongly believe the data maintenance part of the application can
be useful in a broader wide of applications. Hence our initiative to
carve it out as a seperate open source project.

We are actively seeking feedback and contributions from souls interested
in taking this project with us to the next level.
