Each user can update the configuration of the reports to suite his needs and taste.

Click the customize icon in the tool bar to bring up a popup window where the user
can update:

* | **Fields to be shown**:
  | Click on a field to toggle its visibility.
  | Note that the key field of a table cannot be hidden.

* | **Order of the fields**:
  | Drag and drop a visible field to the desired position.

* | **Number of frozen columns**:
  | Select the number of columns that stay in place when you scroll to the right.

* | **Column width**:
  | Changing the column width is not done from the popup window, but directly
    in the report itself.
  | Hover the mouse over the boundary between 2 columns, holds the mouse down and
    drag to the correct width.

* | **Filters, sorting and paging**:
  | :doc:`Filtering criteria <filtering-data>`, :doc:`sorting <sorting-data>`
    and page number are preserved. When you re-open the report later on it will
    opens exactly as when you left it.

The settings are stored on the server when you hit the OK button.
