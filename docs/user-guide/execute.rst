The status section at the top of the screen is refreshed every 5 seconds.
You can disable the refreshing by clicking on the autorefresh icon.

| Tasks launched in this screen are all executed asynchronously: when you hit
  the launch button the task is added to a job queue. A separate worker process
  will execute the tasks from the queue.

| All the actions (and more) can also be performed synchronously
  from the command line with the frepplectl script: see
  :doc:`/integration-guide/batch-commands`
  
| It is also possible to launch tasks through a web interface: see 
  :doc:`/integration-guide/remote-commands`
