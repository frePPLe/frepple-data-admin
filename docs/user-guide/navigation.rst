Navigating the user interface is easy and intuitive.

* | **Menu bar**
  | Doesn't need explanation...
  | Screens to which you have no permissions will not be shown in the menu.

* | **Jump search**
  | Enter 2 or more characters in the search box, and a list of matching
    objects is shown to you.

* | **Breadcrumbs**
  | The breadcrumbs allow you to navigate with a single click to a screen
    you visited before.

* | **Detail links**
  | The modelling objects have an triangular icon next to them. Clicking on
    it will open a screen with a selection of detailed reports on the
    object.

The screenshot below illustrates each of these methods.
