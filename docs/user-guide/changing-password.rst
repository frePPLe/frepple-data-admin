Changing your password
======================

From the top right of the screen "My Preferences" or from the menu bar a screen can be opened where you can change your password.

Users often choose poor passwords. 
We enforce a certain validation rules for passwords:

* Passwords need to be at least 8 characters.

* Passwords cannot be similar to the user name, email address, first name or last name.

* Passwords cannot be entirely numeric.

* Password cannot be part of a list of commonly used passwords.

An administrator can use the user administration screen to change passwords as well.
